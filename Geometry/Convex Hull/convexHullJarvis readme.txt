1) Initialize p as leftmost point.
2) Do following while we don’t come back to the first (or leftmost) point.
…..a) The next point q is the point such that the triplet (p, q, r) is counterclockwise for any other point r.
…..b) next[p] = q (Store q as next of p in the output convex hull).
…..c) p = q (Set p as q for next iteration).
